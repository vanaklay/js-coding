# Combination

## Create a program that displays all the different possible combinations of three digits in ascending, ascending order.

```
$ node exo_01.js
012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017, 018, 019, 023, 024, ... , 789
```

987 is not there because 789 is present.

020 is not there because 0 appears twice.

021 is not there because 012 is present.

000 is not there because this combination does not exclusively consist of digits different from each other.
