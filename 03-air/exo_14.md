## Create a program that checks if the exercises for your air test are present in the directory and that they work (except this one). Create at least one test for each exercise

```
$ node exo_14.js
air00 (1/3) : success
air00 (2/3) : success
air00 (3/3) : success
air01 (1/2) : success
air01 (2/2) : failure
air02 (1/1) : success
...
Total success: (56/62)
```

Bonus: find a way to use green and red to make successes and failures more visible.
